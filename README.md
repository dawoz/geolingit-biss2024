# MINERVA VS Camoscio VS LLaMAntino

### **Authors**: [Davide Savarro] [Davide Zago] [Stefano Zoia] 

This repository includes some code to fine-tune, and test three different model: MINERVA, Camoscio (actually the ExtremITA modified version) and LLaMAntino.
The code is split over two different notebooks: a fine-tuning file and an inference file.

In the file secret.txt you have to insert your HuggingFace Access Token to at least access the original MINERVA model and tokenizer before starting the fine-tuning phase
